            <h4>2020-2021 | Programming Hero Learner</h4>
            <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself a removed web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero. The Programming Hero community is really helpful. That's why I take their course and I am optimistic.</p>
